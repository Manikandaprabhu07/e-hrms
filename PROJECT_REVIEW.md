# E-HRMS Project Review for College Presentation

## 1. Project Abstract
**Project Title:** Enterprise Human Resource Management System (E-HRMS)

**Overview:**
The E-HRMS is a modern, responsive web application designed to digitize and streamline human resource administrative processes. It serves as a centralized platform for managing employee data, attendance, payroll, leave requests, and performance tracking. The system features Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to provide tailored interfaces for Administrators and Employees, ensuring data security and improved operational efficiency.

## 2. Technology Stack
This project leverages the latest web development technologies and best practices:

*   **Frontend Framework:** **Angular** (Latest Version)
    *   Uses **Standalone Components** for reduced boilerplate.
    *   **Angular Signals** for high-performance reactive state management.
    *   **New Control Flow** syntax (`@if`, `@for`) for cleaner template logic.
*   **Programming Language:** **TypeScript** (Strict typing for robust code).
*   **Styling & UI:** 
    *   **CSS3** with CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for theming.
    *   **Glassmorphism** design aesthetic (frosted glass effects) for a modern look.
    *   **Responsive Design** (Flexbox & CSS Grid) for mobile and desktop compatibility.
*   **Architecture:** Modular Architecture with Lazy Loading for optimized performance.
*   **Data Simulation:** **Mock Backend Interceptor** to simulate REST API calls and database interactions without a live server.
